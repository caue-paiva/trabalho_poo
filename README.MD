# FIFA Database Project

## Project Description

The FIFA Database Project is a desktop application developed in Java Swing for a user-friendly graphical interface. It allows the manipulation of player data from FIFA 2017 to FIFA 2023 games. This project uses socket communication in Python to interact with a backend developed in the C language for the [File Organization](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=SCC0215&codcur=55041&codhab=0) course, also offered by our university.

### Features

- **Load data**: loads player data files from FIFA 2017 to 2023.
- **Search**: Search for players using various criteria.
- **View and Edit**: View detailed player information, edit and update records.
- **Delete**: Removes player records from the database.
- **Socket Communication**: The Java GUI connects to a Python server, which communicates with a C program to perform operations on data files.

## Installation

### Requirements

- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Linux

Setting up the environment on Linux is straightforward. Please refer to the official documentation or online resources if you encounter any issues.

### Windows

#### Step 1: Install Make

1. Install Chocolatey from [here](https://chocolatey.org/install).
2. Open PowerShell as an administrator and run:

    ```powershell
    1. choco install make
    ```

3. If Python or OpenJDK/Java is not installed, you can install them via Chocolatey as well.

#### Step 2: Install GCC

1. Download MinGW from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).
2. Run the installer as an administrator and follow the installation steps. On the installation manager screen, select the option with `gcc - g++`.

3. Go to the "Installation" menu at the top and click "Apply Changes".

#### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and open it.

    ![Environment Variables](readmeImgs/w.png)

2. Click on "Environment Variables".
3. Select the "Path" variable and click "Edit".

    ![Edit Path](readmeImgs/a.png)

4. Add a new entry with the path where GCC was installed, typically: ``C:\MinGW\bin``

5. Confirm the changes. To verify the installation, open PowerShell and run:

    ```bash
    1. gcc --version
    ```

6. Restart the computer to ensure all changes take effect.

## Usage

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caue-paiva/trabalho_poo.git
```
```bash
cd trabalho_poo
```

### Run the Program

#### Linux

```
make
```
```bash
make run
```

#### Windows

```powershell
make
```
```powershell
make clean
```
```powershell
make run_server
```

In another PowerShell window, run:

```powershell
make run_interface
```

## Project Structure

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

- Load FIFA data files.
- Search for players by ID, age, name, nationality, and club.
- Display search results and allow selection for detailed view and editing.
- Delete player records.
- 
### Server and Communication

- The GUI connects to a Python server using sockets.
- The Python server translates commands and interacts with a C program to manipulate the data files.
- Each GUI connection has its own copy of the indexed file.

## Important Notes

- The system is designed to run on both Windows and Linux.
